# My Portfolio

## Desription

This webpage was built as a first portfolio where i can showcase my work. It was built following several lessons on CSS with a focus on flex and grid display properties. I have tried to incorporate those attributes in the portfolio where possible, as well as exploring my own creativity with colour and style choices through using CSS.

The first two linked pages in the My Work section are two pages i have built alongside my bootcamp course. The first was the first page i built (and is still being worked on) as a tribute/biography of Kobe Bryant, and the second is a webpage for a fictional skateboard brand, where i have created the concept, content and design of the webpage.
