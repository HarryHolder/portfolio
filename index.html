          <p id="text">My journey with HTML and CSS started long before I knew there was such a thing as a web developer. 
When Myspace became the biggest social media platform on the internet, granted it was short lived, 
people began to experiment with basic CSS to change font-family or text colour on their pages. <br/>
Myself and a few of my friends saw this opportunity to really try and push to boundaries of what a 
website like myspace would allow its users to do.<br/>
We started with moving the elements of the page around to change layouts, 
changing font sizes and colours, as well as completely removing parts of the page. 
Eventually we started using image positioning to completely transform the simple Myspace page into something unrecognisable from its original form.<br/>
Unfortunately there was no educational focus on these skills at school during this time, and my love for it dwindled away.<br/>
I have moved career several times in the last few years, and it has brought me back to something I didnâ€™t realise I was missing. 
I have since completed several free online courses in web development and am currently enrolled in a 16 week bootcamp course to become a junior web developer.
